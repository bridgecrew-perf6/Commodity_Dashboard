# Commodity_Dashboard

This web application is intended to provide an interactive view of the most liquid commodity markets.
All code is stored in the commodity_dashboard.py file with necessary imports made available in the
requirements.txt file. 

Historical price data has been compiled from each of the corresponding futures exchanges and is pulled 
using the Quandl API. Within the web application, output may be modified by selecting an end date 
and page view from the sidebar. Additional interactive parameters will be available on each subsequent page.

A public url has been created using Streamlit share:  https://share.streamlit.io/schwnb0/commodity_dashboard/main/commodity_dashboard.py.
